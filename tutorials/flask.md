# Getting Started with Flask

Flask is designed to make it easy to build web applications quickly and with minimal code. 

## What is Flask?

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries, yet it provides components for developing web applications. Flask is simple, easy to learn, and doesn't impose any dependencies on you.

## Why Flask?

- **Lightweight:** Flask is designed to be lightweight and modular. You have the flexibility to choose the components you need for your specific project.

- **Easy to Learn:** Flask's simplicity makes it an excellent choice for beginners. You can get started quickly and gradually explore more advanced features as needed.

- **Extensible:** Despite its simplicity, Flask is highly extensible. You can easily integrate it with other libraries and tools to build robust and scalable applications.

- **Widely Used:** Flask is widely used in the Python community and has a large and active user base. This means plenty of resources and community support are available.
